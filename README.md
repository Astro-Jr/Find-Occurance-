# Function

So this is a function to find occurances
which means <code>This will count the repeated numbers in the list which is dedicated</code>

# How does It works
<ul type="i">
  <li>
    set the 
    <code>list variable</code>
    in the <code style="font-family: monospace; border:1px solid #fff; border-radius:2.5px;">list parameter</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    then set the num which you want to see how many times it is repeated in the<code>list variable</code> in the <code>list parameter</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    the Function will automatically start to find it when it is runned
  </li>
  
</ul>

# Another app.js?

so this is the same method.
set the parameteres. So basically it is much smaller in code. it used
a built-in JavaScript function <code> reduce()</code>
and <code> ternary operator "?"</code>
